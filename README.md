# Financial Ratio Visualization


Python-based financial analysis dashboard using Pandas, NumPy, Plotly Express, and Streamlit. 
The dashboard fetches income statement and balance sheet data for any given company from the Financial Modeling Prep API. 
It calculates and visually presents crucial financial ratios, including liquidity (current, quick, cash ratios) and turnover metrics (receivables turnover, inventory turnover, payables turnover).
The user-friendly interface allows for easy exploration of trends over time, offering valuable insights into the financial health and performance of the selected company.
